# Travidox Scraping API

This service is a dedicated Node.js application responsible for scraping financial news and data from various web sources. The data collected by this API is used by the Travidox platform to provide users with real-time insights.

## 📜 Features

*   **Targeted Scraping:** Scripts are designed to extract specific data points like news headlines, articles, and market statistics.
*   **Data Processing:** Raw scraped data is cleaned and formatted into a structured JSON format.
*   **Modular Design:** Easily extendable to add new data sources or scraping targets.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the scraping API running locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   npm

### Installation

1.  **Navigate to the API directory:**
    ```sh
cd Scarape_API
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *This project appears to use built-in Node.js modules, but if you add external packages, you would install them here.*
    ```sh
    # Example: npm install
   ```

3.  **Run the scraping script:**
    *The main script appears to be `t.js`. You can run it using Node.js.*
    ```sh
    node t.js
    ```

## ⚙️ How It Works

1.  The `t.js` script sends requests to predefined financial websites.
2.  It uses Node's built-in `https` module to fetch HTML content.
3.  The raw HTML is then parsed (likely using string manipulation or a dedicated library if added) to extract the required data.
4.  The extracted data is structured into a JSON format and can be saved or served via an API endpoint (if an HTTP server is implemented).
