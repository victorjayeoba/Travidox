## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The Travidox platform is composed of three main services:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Users] --> B{Travidox Frontend};
    B --> C{Travidox Backend};
    B --> D{AI Assistant API};
    C --> E[Database];
    C --> F[Scraping API];

    subgraph "Services"
        B; C; F;
    end

    subgraph "External"
        D; E;
    end
```

1.  **`travidox_frontend/`**: A Next.js application that serves as the user-facing dashboard. It communicates with our backend and the Gemini API.
2.  **`travidox_backend/`**: A Python-based service (likely FastAPI or Flask) that handles business logic, user data, and trading operations.
3.  **`Scarape_API/`** (assuming 'Scrape'): A dedicated Node.js service for scraping financial data from various web sources.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up the full Travidox platform, you will need to run each of the three services.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js** (v18 or later) for the Frontend and Scraping API.
*   **Python** (v3.9 or later) for the Backend.
*   **Git** for cloning the repository.
*   **Firebase Account** for database and authentication services.
*   **Google Gemini API Key** for the AI Assistant.

### Installation & Setup Guide

Each service has its own setup instructions. Please refer to the `README.md` file within each directory for detailed guidance:

*   **[Frontend Setup](./travidox_frontend/README.md)**
*   **[Backend Setup](./travidox_backend/README.md)**
*   **[Scraping API Setup](./Scarape_API/README.md)**

A general workflow is:
1.  Set up the backend and database first.
2.  Set up the scraping API to ensure data is flowing.
3.  Set up the frontend, which connects to the other services.
