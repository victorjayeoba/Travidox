## What is Financial Literacy?
Financial literacy refers to the knowledge and skills needed to make effective and informed money management decisions. In Nigeria, having strong financial literacy skills is crucial due to the unique economic challenges we face:

1. **High Inflation Rates**: Understanding how to preserve purchasing power
2. **Currency Fluctuations**: Managing the effects of Naira volatility
3. **Diverse Investment Options**: Navigating between traditional savings, stocks, and alternative investments
4. **Economic Uncertainty**: Building financial resilience in an unpredictable environment

## Why Financial Literacy Matters in Nigeria

- Helps you make better financial decisions despite economic challenges
- Enables you to build wealth even in high-inflation environments
- Provides tools to avoid common financial mistakes and scams
- Creates a pathway to financial independence and security
- Empowers you to teach good money habits to your family and community`

## What is Technical Analysis?
Technical analysis is the study of historical price action and volume data to forecast future price movements. Unlike fundamental analysis, which focuses on company financials and economic factors, technical analysis concentrates purely on market data.

## Core Principles of Technical Analysis

### 1. Price Discounts Everything
In the Nigerian market, as elsewhere, the price of a security reflects all known information affecting that security. This includes economic factors, company performance, market sentiment, and political developments unique to Nigeria.

### 2. Price Moves in Trends
Nigerian stocks, like global markets, tend to move in trends rather than randomly. Once established, a trend is more likely to continue than reverse until significant forces cause a change in direction.

### 3. History Tends to Repeat Itself
Market psychology causes recognizable patterns to appear repeatedly in Nigerian stocks. Identifying these patterns can help predict future price movements.

## Key Technical Analysis Tools for Nigerian Stocks

### Chart Types
- **Line Charts** - Simplest form showing closing prices
- **Bar Charts** - Shows open, high, low, and close (OHLC)
- **Candlestick Charts** - Popular in Nigeria for visualizing price action

### Essential Indicators for NGX Stocks
- **Moving Averages** - Smooth out price data to identify trends
- **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** - Measures speed and change of price movements
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** - Shows relationship between two moving averages

### Important Chart Patterns in Nigerian Markets
- **Support and Resistance Levels** - Price barriers that are difficult to break through
- **Head and Shoulders** - Reversal pattern frequently seen in NGX stocks
- **Double Tops and Bottoms** - Another common reversal pattern in Nigerian markets`

## Why News Matters in Forex Trading

Economic news and events create some of the largest price movements in the forex market, especially for the Nigerian Naira (NGN) and other emerging market currencies. When news is released that differs from market expectations, it can cause rapid, volatile price movements that present both high risk and high reward opportunities.

## Key News Events Affecting the Nigerian Naira

### Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Decisions
- **Interest Rate Announcements**: Higher rates typically strengthen the Naira, while lower rates weaken it
- **Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) Statements**: Policy guidance and economic outlooks
- **Intervention Actions**: Direct market interventions to stabilize the Naira

### Nigerian Economic Indicators
- **Inflation Data**: Higher inflation typically weakens the Naira
- **GDP Reports**: Strong growth can strengthen the currency
- **Unemployment Figures**: Rising unemployment may weaken the Naira
- **Oil Production/Prices**: As Nigeria's main export, oil significantly impacts the Naira

### International Events Affecting the Naira
- **US Federal Reserve Decisions**: Impact global capital flows affecting Nigeria
- **Global Oil Market News**: Directly affects Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings
- **Geopolitical Events**: Regional stability issues impact investment in Nigeria

## How News Creates Trading Opportunities

### Types of Market Reactions
1. **Spike and Reversal**: Quick price jump followed by return to previous levels
2. **Sustained Trend**: News creates a new directional movement
3. **Breakout**: News pushes price through key support/resistance levels
4. **Increased Volatility**: Wider price swings without clear direction

### Volatility Patterns Around News
- **Pre-News Quiet Period**: Often reduced trading activity before major announcements
- **Initial Spike**: First reaction often overextended
- **Secondary Movements**: More measured price action after initial reaction
- **Aftershocks**: Related news items can cause additional volatility`
